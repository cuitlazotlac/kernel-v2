# üå† Module 0 - An Introduction to Kernel

Kernel is an 8 week program, and we'll be covering a new learning module each week. 
Each module is made up of two sections: **Crafted Reading**, which we encourage you to 
have read before the beginning of each new week; and **Curated Briefs** which are made up of 
articles, videos, and the occasional podcast that we _highly recommend_ you go over before the 
Fireside Chat each week.

The Learn Track aims to provide a more holistic framing of what Web 3 is ‚Äî its principles, 
history, and present state. We know that different people learn differently, hence the mix of 
text, video and audio. The "Crafted Readings" have emojis next to them in the menu and you will need 
to read both pieces to participate fully in each week's activities. 

## A Brief Word

The curated briefs are much more paradoxical documents. Firstly, they tend to be quite long. _Do I contradict myself? Very well, I contradict myself. I am large, I contain multitudes_.

Secondly, they refer very closely to their hypermedia source material: videos, podcasts, or blogs. In the online world, we can embed this source material right at the top of each piece, which helps contextualise what is happening. Of course, that luxury is not available to us in this more physical form.However, the fact that there are no other links to distract you means that this physical book may actually better surface some of the ideas held in each brief and make it clearer how they relate to the fractured whole this book represents.

Each brief begins with a few scene-setting sentences and then a section called ‚ÄúHow Does This Fit Into Kernel?‚Äù, meant to describe succinctly why this particular piece has been included in our work and what role it plays in the larger learning arc we present. Hopefully this will help you find your way despite missing the original pieces from whence the brief emanates.

Lastly, briefs are largely made up of others‚Äô words. To explain this, I‚Äôll slip back into the first person. One of the things which has most excited me about producing digital texts of many kinds is that, given the plethora of other voices online, I can say what I genuinely and deeply feel by the simple act of curation. I can demonstrate my own multitudinous contradictions; my own excessiveness; the way things impinge one upon another, without writing my ‚Äúown‚Äù words. Through paying deep attention and truly listening to others, I can represent the ways we are all entangled with this world and show, simply by virtue of these stitched together tattered tapestries of text, how deeply and unspeakably intimate this life is.

Though we all speak our heart differently - and these differences are to be discerned, respected, and celebrated - there is, even in our deepest conflicts, a generativity, a generosity, an abundance that sings of how there is life in dissent, too. When we really know this and can be with it, can with-ness it, without irritation - without even tolerance - then we can remember truly how this life comes from, overflows, and returns to, One.

With all that said, and before we begin in earnest, we‚Äôd like to consider for a moment the kind of conversations we have been carefully cultivating.


## Spaced Repetition

Based on work we'll cover in module 3, Kernel aims to present learning in a new kind of medium which integrates a spaced-repetition memory system. This means you'll need to return to do  future reviews. In a conventional course, you‚Äôd forget most of what you learned over time, perhaps retaining a handful of ideas. However, with spaced repetition built into the medium, a small additional commitment of time means you will remember significantly more. Doing this won‚Äôt be difficult, it will be easier than the initial read. Furthermore, you‚Äôll be able to read other material which builds on these ideas. It will open up an entire world.

Please indulge us by answering the questions you find in the text. For each question, think about what you believe the answer to be, click to reveal the actual answer, and then mark whether you remembered or not. If you can recall, that‚Äôs great. If not, that‚Äôs also fine, just note the correct answer and continue.

This spaced-repetition approach is why the questions only require a few seconds to read and answer. They‚Äôre not complex exercises, in the style of a textbook. Rather, the questions have a different point: the promise each question makes is that you will remember the answer forever. It‚Äôs to permanently change your thinking.

Q: What is my purpose?

A: To change how you think! (And to pass the butter, of course)

## Cultured Conversation

Meaningful conversation can only take place in a culture of respect and courtesy, between people 
who are capable of seeing their highest ideals in others and who can recognise and reflect the 
essential sameness which lies at the heart of each and every human being. 

Cultured conversations tend to resist the temptation to engage in dialogues with the intention to ‚Äútake something away", be it new knowledge, an altered perspective, or an inside story we can leverage for our own gain. Kernel conversations are about *humility*, *presence* and a *genuine attentiveness* towards others, not because you stand to benefit from them, but because cultivating these three capacities within yourself is its own reward, which may allow you to see clearly the complete and perfect sacred core of every person you encounter.

What‚Äôs perfectly whole seems flawed,  
but you can use it forever.  
What‚Äôs perfectly full seems empty,  
but you can‚Äôt use it up.  
  
True straightness looks crooked.  
Great skill looks clumsy.  
Real eloquence seems to stammer.  
  
To be comfortable in the cold, keep moving;  
to be comfortable in the heat, hold still;  
to be comfortable in the world, stay calm and clear.
