# There is freedom in learning

Not all teachers are leaders.   
But all leaders are teachers.  
  
Let me lead you through a desert.  
Here your mouth will turn dry  
And your throat will learn to thirst for knowledge.   
It will be knowledge unknown to us both.  
  
Not all teachers are mothers.  
But all mothers are teachers.  
  
Let me carry you towards thirst  
As you live in gluttony.   
So that you may hunger no more  
And you may rest, as your hands grow idle  
May your mind and heart listen more deeply.  
  
Then will you hear me say: I love you.   
I love you enough to nurture your growth.  
A growth towards the answers you seek  
Hidden beneath the realistic fiction you preach  
You will find a seed of truth  
Covered in a kernel of meaning  
Once that freedom has consumed the spaces you locked away  
Your throat will shudder as you scream, I love you.
